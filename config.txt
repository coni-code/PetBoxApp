for start nodemon server:
   in terminal of server directory:
   npm run dev

   in browser: 
   localhost:5000
   (in this task i prepare simple fetch from endpoint on website. You can see that when start server on localhost:5000/api)
   (in server.js file i prepare route)

------------------------------------
for run website:
    in terminal of client directory:
    npm start

-----------------------------------
npm install 
this command install all nessesery packages in our server and client directory. I think we should make this line in both folders. (client, server)
